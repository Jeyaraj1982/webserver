<h2>Flash action script</h2>
				<p>Action Script is the scripting language Flash uses to control its movies and the objects within those movies. If you want to do anything interactive in Flash, you'll need to use Action Script.

            <div class="tab-panel" id="ajax">
<h2>Ajax</h2>
				<p>Ajax framework is a framework which leverages Ajax, a collection of technologies for building dynamic web pages on the client side. While data is read from and sent to the server by JavaScript requests, frameworks may include server-side or client-side components to process the client's requests. AJAX is a technology incorporating following to develop user-friendly Rich Internet Applications,</p>
<p>Ajax is a good way of using DHTML or JavaScript behavior in browsers to provide dynamic web page contents without having to refresh the page. Ajax provides the interactivity and responsiveness that computer users nowadays expect from the desktop applications.</p>
  
     
  <ul><h3>Benefits of AjaxFurther down are other benefits of Ajax.</h3><br>
                    <li>Saves both time and money</li>
<p>Ajax greatly reduces the total time spent while waiting data to completely transmit. The amount of time that any employee spends waiting for a web page
 to load is greatly reduced.</p>
                    <li>Increases efficiency</li>
 <p>Through this Ajax technology, the employees are able to complete their tasks quickly. This is because an increase in the efficiency of the UI means 
 that the tasks will be done much quicker creating a chance for substantial cost savings.
It also reduces the steps required for completion of a task. This means that the time used also reduces as well as the likelihood of employees 
committing errors. The fewer errors committed will eventually result in cost saving, particularly where certain errors would require 
manual correction.</p>
                    <li>Simpler user interface</li>
                    <p>Nowadays, desktop applications are being replaced by simpler web-based applications. The advantage of offering employees a simple 
					user interface in comparison to the one they were using on their desktop basically means larger initial productivity, fewer errors
					and also lower costs of training.</p>
