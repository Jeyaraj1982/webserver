                It's hard to pin down exactly what is meant by "<b>digital resume</b>," because people in different lines of work have come up with incredibly varied definitions, some with all kinds of bells and whistles and some pretty standard. Generally speaking, the only real requirement for a resume to be "<b>digital</b>" is that you can link to it on the web.

                That means that the information about your work history that you put on LinkedIn, for example, is a digital resume. Likewise, so is the PDF you uploaded to your website or to a resume database. But the term "<b>digital resume</b>" can also include things like graphs, videos, and links to writing, images, and projects you've done, as well as your social media profiles. Basically, the sky is the limit as far as creativity goes, and if you are in a creative industry, it's probably in your best interest to go all out and really try to catch people's attention by making it as visually interesting as possible.
