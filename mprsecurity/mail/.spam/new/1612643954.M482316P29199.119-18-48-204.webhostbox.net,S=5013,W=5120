Dearest,

My name is Rita, I am an account officer in Union Bank Plc. I am contacting
you for a very beneficial business of a huge sum of money from a deceased
account.

I am aware that this letter has come to you as a surprise as we have not
met before or handled any business deal in the past. 

Nevertheless, I have contacted you with good faith and genuine intentions,
and I hope I can trust you with this fund which I will explain to you
immediately I hear from you.

Can we do business? if interested kindly respond to me through my personal
email address below To facilitate the process of this transaction.

Regards,

Rita Graham
