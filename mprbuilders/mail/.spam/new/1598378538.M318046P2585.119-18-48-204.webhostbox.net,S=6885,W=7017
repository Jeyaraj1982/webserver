& the Chairman COMMITTEE ON CONTRACTS CLAIM BETWEEN 2005 TO 2020. His
Excellency,President Alassane Ouattara ordered for immediate review
and investigation on contracts awarded to both Local and Foreign
contractors starting from 2005 to date, both executed and non-executed
for immediate review and payment on any contract satisfactorily done
and confirmed to be legally awarded by this committee.

I decided to seek your confidential co-operation to stand as the
rightful beneficiary to one of the contract payment which nobody knows
the outcome of this investigation as its on me as the chairman to put
up a final report. I decided to keep it confidential to seek your
opinion on this matter. " I HAVE INTEREST ON THIS FUND" and I will
write a favorable report on your behalf confirming this claims to be
genuine.

I came accross your email contact and i pick up interest to write you
for investment plan and finances towards legal procedures.The said
contract fund worth the sum of twenty million five hundred thousand
United States Dollars ($20,500,000.00).

I Know there will be something coming to your mind right now, WHY ME and
WHAT IS MY GAIN? once I receive your reply to Partner with me the question
will be answered and also I will explain to you how the deal will be finali=
se.

Please if you're interested kindly get back to me for more details via
my email at:  jean.billa@yahoo.fr

Thanks and waiting for your response.
Regards,
Dr.Am=C3=A9d=C3=A9 Koffi Kouakou.
