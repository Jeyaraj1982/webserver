                         In order to use a domain name, it must be registered with a registry. ICANN maintains a current directory of accredited registrars. The domain name is registered for a specified period of time. i.e. one year, up to a maximum
of ten years, and is renewable on an ongoing basis. When you purchase a domain name, it only belongs to you for the specified time you stated, in this case, one year. As long as you continue to renew it in a timely fashion, it 
will belong to you. It is important to keep track of the renewal period because if the domain name is not renewed, it can be registered by anyone for their own use.
