								<h5 class="title-blue"><strong>Search Mobile Optimization</strong></h5><br>
								<p>Social Media Optimization (SMO) is a wonderful way of generating website popularity and connecting people together with different point of views and interests through various social media websites like online communities, blogs and forums. Internet users here meet together to discuss a certain topic, share ideas on various issues or simply express whatever they feel like.
<br><br>
Social Media Optimization includes adding RSS feed, blogging and forums, where people are free to express their views and can comment on each other posts. Social networking websites have proven to be very popular in the past few years and the opportunity to use them for search engines, business promotion, online marketing and website promotion is very interesting. 
<br>
<br>
You can always target more traffic through SMO by using various social networking websites like Digg, Furl, Stumble Upon and many more. Active participation in various community forums and healthy discussions with meaningful inputs can automatically increase the value and help in attracting the people to your website. 
<br>
