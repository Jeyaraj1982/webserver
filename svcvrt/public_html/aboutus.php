                                    Education is an end less process needed for the development of any nation. India being one of the
                                    developing country concentrates on four aspects of youth education as maximum percent of youth are 
                                    in our country and who are going to build this universe. The four central aspects of youth education 
                                    are identified as: (1) lifelong learning;(2) an amplified version of basic education which includes pre-school, 
                                    elementary and secondary level education; (3) links between formal and non-formal education; and (4) education for work.

                                    First three are practiced by all the schools but the schools less concern the last one education for work. 
                                    This aspect can be affected by means of vocational training.

                                    The role of education in facilitating social and economic progress has long been recognized. Education improves 
                                    functional and analytical ability and thereby opens up opportunities for individuals and also groups to achieve 
                                    greater access to labour markets and livelihoods. A better educated labour force is essential if we are to meet 
                                    the labour supply requirements of faster growth. Education is not only an instrument of enhancing efficiency but 
                                    is also an effective tool of widening and augmenting democratic participation and upgrading the overall quality 
                                    of individual and societal life.

                                    Skills and knowledge are the engines of economic growth and social development of any country. Countries 
                                    with higher and better levels of knowledge and skills respond more effectively and promptly to challenges 
                                    and opportunities of globalization. India is in transition to a knowledge based economy and its competitive 
                                    edge will be determined by the abilities of its people to create, share and use knowledge more effectively. 
                                    This transition will require India to develop workers into knowledge workers who will be more flexible, analytical, 
                                    adaptable and multi skilled.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    In the new knowledge economy the skill sets will include professional, managerial, operational, behavioral, 
                                    inter personal and inter functional skills. To achieve this goals, India needs flexible education and training 
                                    system that will provide the foundation for learning, secondary and tertiary education and to develop required 
                                    competencies as means of achieving lifelong learning.
