Keeping alive the soldiers in the heart is one of the best things to show gratitude towards them, and staying intact to this “Hall of Fame” was built. Holding a wide array of weapons of the Indo-Pak war this place is all devoted to showcase the grandeur of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe museum is majorly segmented into two parts the upper part consists of the variants of weapons and arms while the other part holds the apparels which were worn by the soldiers at the time of war. On the lower floor, you can spot several paintings and scenes of the Kargil war which set an exemplary of their never give up attitude.

Come and spend a few hours at Pangong Lake! A pristine place in Ladakh marked by subtle to high peaks around, crystal blue waters and the vast expansion catches the eye so much, so long as if a magic is happening right in front of the eyes.\r\n\r\nPangong Lake, also known as Pangong Tso, lies calmly at a breathtaking elevation of 14,270 feet. Interestingly, the lake is 12 km long and marks itself between the laps of India and China. Rather, 60% of the portion is stretching in the neighboring nation and this excites every traveler to be here.\r\n\r\nThe surreal clean blue waters are actually brackish or salty in nature and this feature doesn’t let any aquatic life survive in the same. Moreover, the temperature range between -30 to -10 degrees make even this salty lake freeze with thick ice sheets, which is quite opposite in case of salt ridden water bodies.\r\n\r\nThis picturesque landscape location enhances its beauty with the arrival of migrating birds every year and attracts many travelers in search of adventure, photographs, bird-watching and chilling experience.

The mosque fuses Mameluke, Ottoman, and Fatimid design elements to create a harmonious and thoroughly modern mosque that celebrates Islamic architecture. Artisans used glass-work, mosaic tiling, and intricate carvings to spectacular effect on both the interior and exterior.\r\nIt was opened in 2007 after nearly 20 years of construction. Able to hold 40,000 worshippers, it is the biggest mosque in the United Arab Emirates, and like the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Fujairah, it is dedicated to the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan.\r\nNon-Muslims are allowed into all areas of the mosque (including the vast library), and guided tours are available. The Abu Dhabi Morning Tour is a good way to get acquainted with the city. This four hour tour visits the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, the bustling markets and fishing harbor of Al Mina, and the heritage village with a local guide. Transport and hotel pickup and drop-off are included.\r\nThis branded theme park brings the thrill of Formula One racing to Abu Dhabi and is one of the city\'s top things to do for thrill seekers and families alike. Small children can test out newly learned driving skills on the Junior GT track, while adrenaline junkies can buckle up and ride the Flying Aces roller coaster, which clocks up speeds of 120 kilometers per hour on a 52-meter loop (the tallest in the world).\r\nThere\'s also a collection of Ferrari\'s cars, with models dating back to 1947, and a Ferrari factory tour and Ferrari knowledge game show for true car nerds.\r\nObservation Deck \r\nAbu Dhabi\'s answer to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is this observation deck, offering skyline views from the highest point in the city, on the 74th floor of the Jumeirah at Etihad Towers hotel. There is an entry fee for non-guests of the hotel, but the ticket price can be redeemed for food and drink from the observation deck\'s restaurant, which serves snacks and light bites; soft drinks; and in the afternoon, high-tea. Having high-tea up here, with the city spread below you, is definitely an experience for your Abu Dhabi itinerary.\r\nYas Island\r\nYas Island is one of Abu Dhabi\'s top luxury hotel destinations, with stretches of sandy beach that are perfect for spending the day sunbathing. This area is also home to the Yas Marina Circuit, which is where Abu Dhabi\'s Formula One racing takes place every year. Sun seekers should beeline straight to Yas Beach; adrenaline fans can book a Formula One experience at Yas Marina Circuit; and shoppers should head straight to Yas Mall, the city\'s premier shopping destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n','2021-01-28 12:46:56',1,NULL,4,5,'Dubai / Desert safari / Abu dhabi',NULL);

It\'s no wonder that the city is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world and welcomes over 45 million visitors every year.\r\n\r\nEiffel Tower\r\nThe symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark. This structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 1889. Originally loathed by critics, the 320-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris skyline.\r\nThe Eiffel Tower\'s gracefulness has earned it the nickname of \"Iron Lady.\" Visitors are impressed by the tower\'s delicate airiness despite its monumental size and the breathtaking panoramas at each of the three levels.\r\nTourists can dine with a view at the first level or indulge at the Michelin-starred Le Jules Verne restaurant on the second level. At the exhilarating height of 276 meters, the top level offers a sweeping outlook over the city of Paris and beyond.

The square is busy with tourists and locals at all times of year, but especially in August of alternate years, when the center is filled with the 75- by 24-meter Flower Carpet, made up of more than 700,000 cut begonias.\r\nBrussels\r\nUnlike beautiful Bruges and Ghent, with their hordes of tourists, Brussels is Belgium\'s main economic and educational hub, which gives the city a more workaday feel than other towns. Here, you get a proper feel for Belgian life, especially its fantastic restaurant and café culture.\r\nMannekin Pis\r\nAlong the Rue de l\'Etuve is Brussels\' best-known landmark, the Manneken Pis, usually besieged by a throng of tourists.\r\nAlthough he can be traced back to at least 1388, nothing much is known about the origin of the figure of a little boy urinating, popularly referred to as \"the oldest citizen of Brussels.\"\r\nThe Manneken is, however, surrounded by various legends. According to one, the fountain is a memorial to a courageous infant who averted a conflagration, according to another, it commemorates the son of a count who succumbed to a pressing urge while taking part in a procession.\r\nThe present statue was made in 1619 by Jérôme Duquesnoy the Elder and has been stolen on several occasions though always recovered. During major celebrations, events, and festivals in Brussels, the statue is famed for being dressed in costume.\r\nAtomium | wing1990hk / photo modified\r\nAlong with Manneken Pis, the Atomium is Brussels\' best-known landmark attraction, and although it\'s a bit of a journey by tram to get out here, the bizarre 102-meter-high steel and aluminum structure, designed by the architect André Waterkeyn for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition, is the city\'s most surreal sight.\r\nThe building represents a molecule of iron magnified 165 million times.\r\nToday, visitors can enter the building to explore its sci-fi-style interiors. The lower spheres are home to a permanent exhibition on the history of the structure. The upper sphere has incredible panoramas across the city.\r\nCinquantenaire\r\nThe Parc du Cinquantenaire was established in 1880 to commemorate the country\'s 50th anniversary.\r\nIts centerpiece is the monumental Palais du Cinquantenaire, the two wings of which, linked in 1905 by a massive triumphal arch designed by the French architect Charles Girault, house two of Brussels\' most interesting museums.\r\nThe Royal Art and History Museum is home to Belgium\'s national archeaology collections, with pieces drawn from throughout the world, as well as one of the most extensive tapestry collections in the world.\r\nThe Belgian Army Museum and Museum of Military History (Koninklijk Museum van het Leger en van de Militaire Geschiedenis) provides an overview of the development of military technology and of the major campaigns fought on Belgian soil.\r\nEurope Parliament\r\nThe European Parliament (EP) is the legislative branch of the European Union and one of its seven institutions. ... The European Parliament decides upon EU legislation, including the multiannual budget, together with the Council of the European Union (EU Member State governments).\r\nArt Nouveau architecture characteristics\r\n\r\nArt Nouveau, ornamental style of art that flourished between about 1890 and 1910 throughout Europe and the United States. Art Nouveau is characterized by its use of a long, sinuous, organic line and was employed most often in architecture, interior design, jewelry and glass design, posters, and illustration.\r\n\r\nAmsterdam\r\nAmsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe. With its universities, academies, and research institutes, along with more than 40 museums, numerous theaters, and entertainment venues, Amsterdam is also the country\'s leading cultural center.\r\n','2021-01-29 12:54:31',1,NULL,3,5,'Pairs/ Brusesels/ Amsterdam',NULL);

Built as tombs for the mighty Pharaohs and guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx, Giza\'s pyramid complex has awed travelers down through the ages and had archaeologists (and a fair few conspiracy theorists) scratching their heads over how they were built for centuries.\r\nToday, these megalithic memorials to dead kings are still as wondrous a sight as they ever were. An undeniable highlight of any Egypt trip, Giza\'s pyramids should not be missed.\r\nKarnak Temple\r\nFamed for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial Temple of Hatshepsut, the Nile-side town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has a glut of tourist attractions. This is ancient Thebes, power base of the New Kingdom pharaohs, and home to more sights than most can see on one visit.\r\nWhile the East Bank brims with vibrant souk action, the quieter West Bank is home to a bundle of tombs and temples that has been called the biggest open-air museum in the world. Spend a few days here exploring the colorful wall art of the tombs and gazing in awe at the colossal columns in the temples, and you\'ll see why Luxor continues to fascinate historians and archaeologists.\r\nAswan\r\nEgypt\'s most tranquil town is Aswan, set upon the winding curves of the Nile. Backed by orange-hued dunes, this is the perfect place to stop and unwind for a few days and soak up the chilled-out atmosphere. Take the river ferry across to Elephantine Island and stroll the colorful streets of the Nubian villages. Ride a camel to the desert monastery of St. Simeon on the East Bank. Or just drink endless cups of tea on one of the riverboat restaurants, while watching the lateen-sailed feluccas drift past.\r\nThere are plenty of historic sites here and numerous temples nearby, but one of Aswan\'s most popular things to do is simply kicking back and watching the river life go by.\r\nEgyptian Museum\r\nA treasure trove of the Pharaonic world, Cairo\'s Egyptian Museum is one of the world\'s great museum collections. The faded pink mansion is home to a dazzling amount of exhibits. It\'s a higgledy-piggledy place with little labeling on offer and not much chronological order, but that\'s half of its old-school charm.\r\nUpstairs is the golden glory of King Tutankhamen and the fascinating royal mummies exhibits, but really every corner you turn here is home to some wonderful piece of ancient art or statuary that would form a highlight of any other museum.\r\nKhan el-Khalili shop\r\nKhan el-Khalili is one of the world\'s great shopping experiences. This Middle Eastern souq (bazaar) is a labyrinthine collection of skinny alleyways established as a shopping district in AD 1400, which still rings with the clang of metal workers and silversmiths.\r\nThe main streets have long ago given themselves over completely to the tourist trade (with plenty of cheap papyrus pictures and plastic pyramids on display), but divert off the main drag into the surrounding alleyways, and the tiny stores and cluttered workshops are some of the best places to pick up traditional products in Egypt. Here, you\'ll find everything from antiques and gorgeous metal lampshades to locally woven textiles.\r\nWhile here stop in at Cairo\'s most famous coffee shop, Fishawis, where syrupy Arabic coffee and sweet tea are dished out to tourists and local merchants alike at a rapid-fire pace.\r\nFor shoppers, the main souq road is Al-Muski Street (called Gawhar al-Qaid Street at its eastern end). The gold and silver workshops mostly congregate just north of this street\'s intersection with Al-Muizz Li-Din Allah Street, while the spice market section is just to the south. The market is hemmed in on its eastern side by the Neo-Gothic bulk of the Sayyidna el-Husein Mosque, built in 1792 to honor the Prophet Muhammad\'s grandson.\r\nThe entry to the Khan el-Khalili area is across the road from Al-Azhar Mosque\r\nNeil cruise\r\nDiscover the Land of the Pharaohs on a Nile cruise, the ultimate adventure for those who want to visit the pyramids and other iconic Egyptian attractions. Cruising the Nile is the best way to explore the sights, with tour options ranging from short hourly trips to longer multi-day sailings.\r\nPhilae Temple\r\nThe sacred Temple of Isis (more commonly known as Philae Temple) is one of Upper Egypt\'s most beguiling monuments both for the exquisite artistry of its reliefs and for the gorgeous symmetry of its architecture, which made it a favorite subject of Victorian painters. Like Abu Simbel, the temple was saved by the rising waters of Lake Nasser by UNESCO\'s rescue project and moved lock-stock-and-barrel from its original home on Philae Island to nearby (higher) Agilika Island where it sits today.\r\nThe Temple of Isis, a center for the ancient cult of Isis, is the main part of the Philae complex, but the island is also home to the Temple of Hathor, the Kiosk of Trajan, and various other buildings from the Roman and Byzantine periods. You can easily reach the temples by taxi from Aswan, although most people arrive here as part of an Abu Simbel day trip tour.\r\nAswan High Dam\r\nAswan\'s High Dam is modern Egypt\'s most lauded and yet controversial building project. Begun in 1960 and taking 11 years to complete, the dam was President Nasser\'s pet project and greatest achievement and was achieved through funding and technical help from the Soviet Union.\r\nThe High Dam has some staggering statistics. Its building took 42.7 billion cubic meters of stone (17 times the volume of the Pyramid of Cheops) with its total length being 3.6 kilometers. It is 980 meters thick at the base and 40 meters at the top. The average capacity of the dam\'s reservoir (Lake Nasser) is 135 billion cubic meters with a maximum capacity of 157 billion cubic meters.\r\nThe dam brought fantastic benefits to the country, allowing sustainable electricity across the country and increasing the amount of arable land in Egypt. However, it also put an end to the annual Nile flood, which fertilized farmer fields with its rich silt deposits, and the creation of Lake Nasser (the world\'s largest artificial lake) wiped away much of Upper Egypt\'s vast heritage as the waters rose.\r\nA four-lane highway runs across the top of the dam where there is a triumphal arch and an inscription commemorating the completion and the cooperation between Egypt and the Soviet Union to build it. Trips to the Aswan High Dam are often included on day trips to Abu Simbel, or you can easily hire a taxi to get here.\r\nKom Ombo temple\r\nToday Kom Ombo (47 kilometers north of Aswan and 168 kilometers south of Luxor) may be a sleepy agricultural backwater surrounded by sugar cane fields, but this temple dedicated to the gods Sobek and Haroeris is a reminder of this area\'s importance in Ancient Egypt due to its prime position along the Nile.\r\nValley of the Kings\r\nThe famed Valley of the Kings, hidden between rocky escarpments, was the final resting place for the kings of the 18th, 19th, and 20th dynasties. Their main attraction is their wonderfully vivid wall paintings. Since it was believed that the dead man, accompanied by the sun god (or perhaps having become one with the sun god) sailed through the underworld at night in a boat, the walls of the tombs were adorned with texts and scenes depicting this voyage and giving the dead man instruction on its course.\r\nWithin the valley are 63 tombs, which are a roll-call of famous names of Egyptian history, including the famous boy-king Tutankhamun. The tombs are open on a rotation system to preserve the paintings as much as possible from the damage caused by humidity.\r\nTemple of Deir al-Bahri (Queen Hatshepsut\'s Temple)\r\nThe Temple of Deir el-Bahri is magnificently situated at the foot of the sheer cliffs fringing the desert hills, the light-colored, almost white, sandstone of the temple standing out prominently against the golden yellow to light brown rocks behind. The temple complex is laid out on three terraces rising from the plain, linked by ramps, which divide it into a northern and a southern half. Along the west side of each terrace is a raised colonnade.\r\nThe terraces were hewn out of the eastern slopes of the hills, with retaining walls of the finest sandstone along the sides and to the rear. The temple itself was also partly hewn from the rock. Inside, the complex is richly adorned with statues, reliefs, and inscriptions. Note how Queen Hatshepsut had herself represented with the attributes of a male pharaoh (beard and short apron) to demonstrate that she possessed all the authority of a king.\r\nColossi of Memnon\r\nBeside the road that runs from the Valley of the Queens and Medinet Habu towards the Nile are the famous gigantic statues known as the Colossi of Memnon. Carved out of hard yellowish-brown sandstone quarried in the hills above Edfu, they represent Amenophis III seated on a cube-shaped throne, and once stood guard at the entrance to the king\'s temple, of which only scanty traces are left. In Roman Imperial times they were taken for statues of Memnon, son of Eos and Tithonus, who was killed by Achilles during the Trojan War.\r\nThe South Colossus is better preserved than the one to the north. It stands 19.59-meters high and the base is partly buried under the sand. With the crown that it originally wore but has long since vanished, the total height must have been some 21 meters.\r\nThe North Colossus is the famous \"musical statue,\" which brought flocks of visitors here during the Roman Imperial period. Visitors observed that the statue emitted a musical note at sunrise and this gave rise to the myth that Memnon was greeting his mother, Eos, with this soft, plaintive note. The sound ceased to be heard after Emperor Septimus Severus had the upper part of the statue restored.\r\nIf you walk behind the statues, you can see the vast site (currently being excavated by archaeologists) where Amenophis III\'s temple once sat.\r\n','2021-01-29 13:55:42',1,NULL,2,5,'Cairo / Aswan / Nile cruise / Luxor',NULL);

Built by Vespasian in AD 72 and enlarged by the addition of a fourth story by his son, Titus, it was a venue for public spectacles and shows - even mock sea battles.\r\nA wooden floor that was 83 by 48 meters covered two additional underground stories with tunnels, rooms, cells, and passages that provided space for gladiators, workers, wild animals, and storage.\r\nToday, the structure stands in stark contrast to the modern development that surrounds it and is a prominent reminder of ancient times and the extensive history of Rome.\r\nVatican City at sunset\r\nThe Vatican is home to some of the world\'s most priceless art and art collections. The centerpiece is the great Basilica of St. Peter, with the tomb of St. Peter and one of Michelangelo\'s most poignant works, the Pieta.\r\nOutside is St. Peter\'s Square, where the Pope addresses followers. The walls and ceilings of the Sistine Chapel are covered with frescoes by Michelangelo, and in the Vatican Palace are works by Raphael and other major artists.\r\nMore art fills the Vatican Museums, a group of individual collections, including sacred art, Etruscan antiquities, sculptures, maps, papal carriages, even vintage cars.\r\nRoman Forum\r\nThe Roman Forum may require a little imagination - or a good tour guide -- to understand exactly what this area once looked like and how it was used. However, its historical significance as the heart of the Roman Empire cannot be overstated.\r\nTemples were built first, then public buildings, and soon the area became Rome\'s governmental center. Commerce followed with the building of market halls that made the Forum the hub of public life for the city, and eventually the Roman Empire.\r\nToday, only pillars, partial structures, and foundations of former temples, market halls, courts, and public buildings pay tribute to Ancient Rome, which survived here for a thousand years.\r\n','2021-01-29 17:42:42',1,NULL,5,5,'Rome / Florence / Venice / Innsbruck / Salzburg / Wien',NULL);

The museum has a wide collection of traditional tools, traditional music instruments, dinosaur models, antiques, jewelry,  etc. are on display here.\r\n\r\nThe museum is an important center for the studies of culture and history in the region. If you are a patron of history and culture, you will have a great time at the museum since it is one of the best places to visit in Shillong\r\nHydari Park\r\nOnce known as Lady Hydari Park, Phan Nonglait Park is among the major tourist attractions in the pretty city of Shillong. It is a Japanese style park that is beautiful and verdant enough to entice fauna and flora lovers.\r\n\r\nApart from housing a great range of flora and many small ponds, the park also encompasses a mini zoo where you can spot animals like Himalayan Black Bear, Jackal, Porcupine, Leopard, and deer among many others. The tranquil atmosphere of the park makes it one of the must-visit places in the city.\r\nDawki\r\nFlanking the south-eastern border of Meghalaya, Dawki is a lovely little town located nearly 82 km away from Shillong. Cradled in the laps of the Jaintia Hills, the thrilling drive to Dwaki is littered with vines and gorges. The highlight of this town is the magical, emerald coloured river Umngot that snakes through it. It is believed to be one of the cleanest rivers in India, and that’s truly admirable. \r\nIt flows between the Jaintia and Khasi Hills, right into Bangladesh. Boating in its waters is an enchanting experience, and makes you feel as if you’re afloat a crystal glass! Dawki is also host to adventures like kayaking, camping, zip lining, and snorkeling. It is a fairytale world, and amongst the loveliest places to visit in Cherrapunji.  \r\n\r\nMawsmai Cave\r\nAmongst the most easily accessible of the many caves in Cherrapunji, Mawsmai Cave is an entryway to the world of underground adventure. It is simple enough to navigate, and you can manage without a guide. One of the most popular places to visit in Cherrapunji, Mawsmai Cave sits about 6 km away from the main town. Shaded under a thick canopy of trees, the cave welcomes you with a yawning entrance and tapers down a bit further ahead. \r\nThe cave walls can get too narrow for two to walk abreast, so large groups should be avoided. As the caves are very well lit, you may feel that some of the thrill fades. But don’t let that deter you, because if you\'ve only just ventured into the world of cave exploration, Mawsmai Cave is an ideal place to start. \r\nThe Eco Park\r\nEco Park sits atop a high plateau and was installed by the government of Meghalaya for tourism. The hill affords beautiful views of the verdant hills crisscrossed by waterfalls, along with the Sohra valley. There also runs a crystal blue stream through the park. A beautiful crossover bridge opens up the sweeping views of the green canyons of Sohra, and the stretching Sylhet Plains of Bangladesh. \r\nThe source of Nohsngithiang Falls, the Eco Park is replete with incredible variants of orchids. The place can be reached easily by road from Shillong. Proof of the diverse beauty of the North-Eastern landscape of India, The Eco Park is one of the most unmissable tourist places in Cherrapunji.\r\nSeven Sisters Falls\r\nSitting within touching proximity to Mawsmai village, Seven Sisters Falls, the fourth highest plunge waterfall in India, is nested within the East Khasi Hills District. It is essentially a cluster of seven different waterfalls, adjacent to each other. Locally known as Nohsngithiang Falls or Mawsmai Falls, this 315 meters high thunderous cascade is one of the most magnificent places in Cherrapunji. \r\nThe waters plummet down the treacherous limestone cliffs of Khasi Hills, and into a cavernous valley. The rising and setting sun bathe the surrounding in a soothing golden hue, and the crystal streak of water glistens with glory. This place is a paradise for shutterbugs, with its picture-perfect surroundings, and stretches of lush greenery. \r\nNohkalikai Falls\r\nPlunging from a dizzying height of 1,120 ft., Nohkalikai Falls in Cherrapunji is the country’s third-highest waterfall. It sits about 5 km away from the town and is undoubtedly one of the most iconic places to visit in Cherrapunji. It flows right out of the pristine forests of a hill and gushed down to form a puddle. Ideally, monsoons bring the falls to full bloom, but the beauty of Nohkalikai Falls can be admired throughout the year.  It is one of the most beautiful Cherrapunji waterfalls.\r\nThe roaring melody of its silver-streaked waters is audible from far off, and the envelope of greenery and mist make it seem like a fairytale. If you wish to explore the place more, there are a series of stairs that take you to different vantage points. There is also an interesting if a bit tragic, legend that revolves around the falls.\r\nKhashi hills\r\nAmong numerous sacred forests in the East Khasi Hills, Mawphlang enjoys a distinctive reverence and is a major tourist site in the region. The forest is house to a wide array of species of plants and trees, some of which are believed to be older than 1,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe forest is a sacred one has certain rules for the visitors so as not to enrage the deity; not removing anything from the forest, for instance. There are various stone temples inside the forest where sacrifices of animals are offered to please the deity. Mawphlang Sacred Forest is simply an excellent site for nature enthusiasts and culture vultures visiting Shillong. \r\n','2021-02-19 18:37:34',1,NULL,3,5,'Shillong  / Cherrapunjee /  guwahati','');
