In effects it is more competent, being the classic dynamic light effects and other paraphernalia.

Thanks to its cryptic development, the few conversations and the captivating environments, it was the best seller of that year in which it stood out for being one of the first games on CD-ROM. With multiple imitators, it must be recognized that few have come to match its atmosphere and intricate puzzles. Thus, its influence is not trivial, and companies like the deceased Cryo have made entire careers taking Myst as a model.\r\n\r\nCurrently, and with the progressive disinterest in adventure games, Myst saw a sad decline in sales, and both Uru and Myst IV were far below the expectations created. In this sense, why do another Myst ?. The answer for fans of the saga is obvious, but for a studio that loses money not so much, so everything that surrounds this fifth installment is somewhat funeral and is intended as the end of a cycle.\r\n\r\nCo-developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Cyan Worlds, Myst V returns to the graphics engine seen in Uru while still maintaining the classic interface. Developed only by Ubisoft Montreal, Myst IV has already corrected Urus highly debatable third-person interface, which breaks both the classic rhythm and the control of some puzzles. Thus, the title is a synthesis between the two previous chapters, which can be seen both in its non-linear design (possibility of choosing eras, influenced by Uru) and in less interactivity (more consistent with the classical tradition of Myst ).','https://www.gamestorrents.nu/juegos-pc/myst-v-end-of-age/','2020-06-19 15:18:44');

The title seems to take inspiration from various science fiction games and movies: how ETR is very reminiscent of the great Imperium Gallactica 2 a few years ago, for its exploratory plot of the universe and the management of different planets. The characters have an air to those that appeared in the also excellent Starcraft, which combined the most advanced technology with a deep spirituality. Other elements of the game are more reminiscent of the world of celluloid: Starship Troopers, for the spider bugs, and Pitch Black, for the arid terrain and nest caves of flying enemies.\r\n\r\nThe argument puts us in command of a colony ship where thousands of people live. We are part of Exodus, a ship community that left Earth in search of the planet of its destiny. For centuries, the ships have traveled through space trying to end their search, but it seems that the moment never comes and two factions of the Exodus rebel, killing the leaders and declaring war on their loyal followers.\r\n\r\nIn Perimeter we can command any of the 3 factions throughout 27 missions in which we will visit numerous planets. We will have at our disposal a total of 28 types of units that can be transformed into another type at any time. The technological advances that we achieve as we progress through the game are key to success: the most important of them is the Perimeter, an impenetrable energy field that will allow us to develop very interesting defense and attack tactics.

The protagonist of Evil Dead returns with a new playable installment that looks like it will finally do justice to the great Sam Raimi saga. Take on the evil creatures of the Necronomicom with your chainsaw. Hail to the king, baby!\r\n\r\nThis new game in the Evil Dead saga has been endowed with action from the beginning, faithfully following the essence of the film saga. It is already known that the character of Ash (the protagonist of the story, played by the aforementioned Bruce Campbell) lives in torment since the day he found the Necronomicom (the book of the dead) in a cabin in the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvil Dead: Regeneration\r\nThe nightmare that was unleashed caused him to lose one of his hands, which he replaced by putting a chainsaw in its place. Armed with his new member and a shotgun, he decided to wipe out the evil creatures that the evil book released. Thus, in this new installment of the saga, Ash will start equipped with both weapons, both of unlimited use, and will make his way through the hordes of demonic beings thanks to them.\r\n\r\nObviously, varied combos can be performed with the different attack options of each weapon, but there will also be final movements in the style of Mortal Kombat fatalities to kill the creatures when their energy bar has lowered enough. All this under a slightly gore bloody touch that remains within what is expected of a title of this franchise truly faithful to the movies.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvil Dead: Regeneration\r\nThe variety of these attacks promises to be high, with hundreds of Ash animations to attack enemies and more than a dozen final attacks. These attacks are most attractive to fans of the saga, since all the cockiness and grace of the character is maintained, either by shooting them directly in the head or even killing them without looking, in full display of airs of grandeur .\r\n\r\nThese attacks will depend on the situation that Ash is in with respect to the enemies and other various factors that will make the character make one movement or another. All this without forgetting the presence of a bar that will indicate the appearance of the evil version of Ash, with whom advancing among the enemies will be even easier and a whole bloodbath, all well within what is seen in the movies.

In addition to adding colors and editing logos, you can add different types of images to choose size and color. Come on, as if to make your motorcycle something unique and unrecognizable.\r\n\r\nThe same happens with the Xtreme mode, but everything lacks licenses there, the riders and the motorcycles are not real, but that in my opinion should not be important since it is about arcade modes where the most important thing will be to tune your machine.

Then a race and an emotion like Rossi awaits you, in the end you can enjoy the best repetitions seen in my opinion in a speed game thanks to 20 different cameras to see the race from all possible points.\r\n\r\nThe multiplayer mode is the best, a place to show your bikes in each way and win your friends.

World War 1 has come and gone and the world has settled into an uneasy peace. The alliance between the United States and the other powers is weak as the powers try to maintain peace in Europe. Fearful of the growing strength of Japan, the United States created a series of plans in case of a peaceful war with Japan. Their name: War Plan Orange. Consisting of three different scenarios, War Plan Orange was a comprehensive and real life What if scenario for the war in the pacific. In the world of Matrix Games a different story is going to unfold, and Japan, seeking natural resources to grow their power, will turn the full strength of their navy against the industrial giant of the United States.\r\n\r\nEnter War Plan Orange: Dreadnoughts in the Pacific 1922-1930, where you will command the pacific fleet for either power in four different campaigns. The two major campaigns will take you from 1922 - 1926 and from 1926 - 1930. With incredible attention to detail and historical accuracy, War Plan Orange is the perfect modification to War in the Pacific for anyone who loves the time period between World War 1 and World War 2. The lack of airpower and inefficient fuels, as well as the natural resources required by both sides make War Plan Orange a completely different experience.\r\n\r\nAdditionally there are two PBEM scenarios included, making War Plan Orange powerful enough to stand on its own, as well as one of the largest mods and expansions to be released for any game.

MechCommander was the first to show us the Mechs war from a different perspective, taking us out of the cabin of these machines to place us in command of the headquarters.\r\nMechCommander 2 will present considerable improvements over the original. For starters, the game will feature a fully 3D engine, reflecting the role terrain elevation plays in engagements. And the old quest structuring of the original will be removed, bringing a much deeper campaign forward.\r\n\r\nPotential\r\nBattletech is an interesting universe, and with MechCommander 2 we will have the possibility to control the most impressive machinery. MechCommander was a good game, despite mission failures and confusing interface.\r\nMicrosoft is in charge of the FASA license and promises a much more accessible and intense experience.

Here, the true darkness at the heart of things comes true. What we see in the domain of death is as empty as the gaze of a dead man, as cold as the light of a dying star.\r\n\r\nThere is a place beyond death, where every soul that has dragged this death spiral finds its spiritual home. It is a place without borders, or hope, or past, or even future, trapped in its infinite present. The land of the dead where the rows of trillions of trillions of souls roam an infinite region towards a dead horizon, crawling through the rumbling corridors of funerals and vast palaces, walking through cursed rotten places of morbid vegetation.\r\n\r\nThis place is known as the dead zone.\r\n\r\nShadow Man History:\r\n\r\nFor many thousands of years, Shadow Man has protected the world from the living from threats that came from a spiritual plan known as the dead zone; place where everyone goes without exception, when he dies.\r\n\r\nMichael LeRoi is the heir to the mysteries of this ancient lineage; the wearer of the mask of shadows. When night falls he becomes the one who walks between the worlds, immortal voodoo warrior, taker of souls, lord of the dead zone ...\r\n\r\nMIKE LEROI:\r\n\r\nMike LeRoi is the character who embodies our hero in real life. A 32-year-old from New Orleans, Mike is a victim of his own weakness.\r\nHaving failed his studies and spent his remaining money for college on drinking and gambling, this unsuccessful English literature student worked as a taxi driver in Chicago, keeping the secret of his suspensions so that his family would not know it. One day in 1991, one of Mikes passengers was executed by the mob, leaving $ 20,000 in the back seat of his taxi.\r\n\r\nMike took the money and went home, paid for the operation of his little brother Luke and made many gifts to his family with his brand new wealth. But unfortunately, the mob was chasing Mike, they followed him to New Orleans and started sending him death threats.\r\n\r\nDesperate, Mike sought out a bokor, a voodoo priestess, to protect him against mob attacks. This worked but it went too far. The mob decided to collect his debt by placing an explosive device in the car that Mike and his family were traveling with. Mikes parents and brother were killed, but in some strange way Mike survived.\r\n\r\nHe managed to recover from a coma and his near-fatal injuries but lost his memory and was driven to the slums of New Orleans by the bokor, it was the price of secrecy for his protection: the curse of being an undead slave to the bokor, working Under the pseudonym ZERO, the amnesiac Mike acted as the executing arm of the bokor, ignorant of his true identity.\r\n\r\nOne night Mamma Nettie, a powerful but dying voodoo priestess stormed the bar of the bokor, the indomitable heart, took Mike to the back room and invoked the powers he had left to implant by force and on Mikes chest the mask of shadows, a powerful voodoo artifact in order to turn him into Shadow Man the supreme undead is now a warrior subjected to the control of Nettie, since then Nettie regained his powers and left the soul of the bokor and the indomitable heart in the property of mike. Mike has gained something: his memory that now haunts him. As the immortal Shadow Man is subjected to Nettie, he cannot end his suffering, until he can break Netties spell he is forced to obey his orders and find some way to atone for his sins.\r\n\r\nShadow Man:\r\n\r\nShadow man is Mikes alter-ego. He who walks between the worlds. The Shadow Man of ancient times were African warriors blessed by the gods with supernatural powers that threatened a plane known as the dead zone and that protected them from native tribes, with the arrival of slavery the lineage of Shadow Man suffered and it almost died out.\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century, the powerful voodoo priestess Mamma Nettie created the mask of shadows, under cover of the gods of the new world {les Mysteres} to make powerful the one who wore the mask and thus be able to access the supernatural power of the Shadow Man of The past. Since then, there would only be one Shadow Man at a time but all the powers gathered inside the mask will produce the most powerful voodoo the world has ever seen. Certainly very powerful in keeping dead zone forces at bay ...\r\n\r\nThere have only been three wearers of the mask before: Maxim St James, Cole Cardinaux and Jack boniface. However, the previous owners wore the mask on their faces, but Mike has it implanted on his chest, becoming his slave and Netties. At night in the dead zone, the mask emerges glowing on his chest turning Mike into Shadow Man immortal voodoo warrior, the one who walks between the worlds, undead astral soul-taker ... lord of the dead zone.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\r\nDirect3D compatible 3D accelerator, Pentium 200 MHz CPU or equivalent, 32MB RAM, 350 MB hard disk space, 8x CD-ROM drive, DirectX 6 or higher (DirectX 6.1 is included), DirectX compatible sound card.

This has prompted the launch of a second part of the stories of this peculiar character created by Santiago Segura and, as it could not be less, has brought the corresponding video game to market. Developed by Virtual Toys and distributed by Electronics Arts, OcioTotal introduces you to Torrente, the cyber arm of the Law.\r\nBased on a mix of both films and in environments that develop real scenarios very widely and precisely, Virtual Toys presents a torrent caricature accurately in a 3D arcade with which the player can assume the role of the crappy police in Spain, either in third or first person.\r\n\r\nMadrid and Barcelona serve as stages for this new and striking Torrente, faithful reflection of the original. The most seedy and prototypically cañi of Spain today are submerged among the bits of the CdRom of the Torrente game program. Fun and certainly well developed Torrente collects the most cinematographic elements. Virtual Toys has counted on the invaluable collaboration of Santiago Segura both in the plot development (it is noted) and in the incorporation of voices with which we will get more than a broad smile.\r\nGame Features\r\nFollowing levels of gameplay in the style of Crazy Taxi O Quake, the games mechanics focus on the action, without the possibility of interacting with other characters. The graphics engine of the Torrente program reproduces cities with a considerable appearance of life thanks to the number of citizens and vehicles that circulate.\r\nFrom the very beginning of the game we begin by evaluating the appropriate doses of humor with which Torrente provides us in this curious arcade. From the implementation of the tutorial program, the absurd gags and the greediness that has already made the character famous, begin to filter through our audio and video.\r\nWe will start in an easily identifiable urban setting. The Torres Kio, Puerta de Europa, Plaza de Castilla or Puerta de Alcala begin to appear on our screen, serving as a backdrop to a new torrent more casposo if possible than that of the film versions.\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable element is that of action. Game levels of exceptional development and infrequent in Spanish video games, lead us to a frantic game action in which the mobility of our antihero is simple and effective. The characters we will meet will be very diverse. Spectacular women sometimes armed to the teeth, thugs from three to four, thieves or dangerous assassins loaded with bazzokas with whom they try to give us a displeasure. Many enemies that as the game progresses will attack in greater numbers, without order or concert and possibly without a predetermined plan, a complete chaos at the service of a game whose fun is guaranteed.\r\nTraffic, noise, screaming, racing, ... a whole interactive world at the service of the most interesting sequel to the reviled police: macho, rude, arrogant and heartless. A sweaty and chubby Solid Snake, a Lara Croft made in Spain with no other curves than that of her huge belly, a 007 with more grace but less grace, but that in any case perhaps represents a part of ourselves and that in Streaming the game, it is effectively entertaining and happily endearing.

This expansion, as it happened with the existing one in the TM Original (Power Up), will be completely free for game owners, without a doubt a detail for users and one that other companies should take good note of. Despite being free, this expansion is by no means a minor update, but rather a complete facelift to many parts of its gameplay, with improvements in the Bay and Coast environments being very notable.\r\n\r\n\r\n3, 2, 1, Hyper speed! Playability at 900 km per hour.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, one of the aspects that has most improved in the gameplay itself has been the inclusion of new sections in the circuits, which forces us to consider the handling of the vehicles, although this has not changed, in the 3 environments differently.\r\n\r\nThe most notable changes in each environment are:\r\n\r\nIsland: a new setting is added, an airport - space base. In this environment we will have to drive between planes and hangars, dodge rockets and other objects. The truth is that this environment is very successful.\r\nNew vertical planes have been added, making it now possible to make very uneven roads, with almost impossible turns and much wider loopings. Fully tubular tunnels that allow us, if we go at high speed, to go through them in any position, even upside down.\r\n\r\nBay: This environment has also had a new setting, the port, full of boats, as well as a San Francisco-style bridge area. Bridge spans are now considerably wider, allowing for wider layouts and much faster circuits. In addition, new, wider metal surfaces, boats from which to jump, etc.\r\n\r\nCoast: without a doubt, the most tedious of all and the least popular among users, as it is extremely slow and technical. The setting of a marina has been added, which adds boats and the possibility of roads between the cliffs. But, like Bay, the new sections make it a faster and more agile way, with long jumps, wider zones, a greater variety of turbo zones, etc.\r\nHowever, all these environments have been endowed with a series of common sections and they are, without a doubt, those that make sense of all these faster and wider sections, and are none other than the new turbo sections. These sections of red color are, to put it mildly, hyper-turbocharged since, in Island mode, they put you at almost 900 km / h at a push, while, in the slowest ones, you can reach 400, something which is highly appreciated, especially in Coast mode. This new way of playing is, especially on Island, a real joy, since if this mode could be frenzied before, this now makes it absolutely insane although, that yes, handling so much gross speed is not easy and does not enter correctly Focusing on one of these turbos can send you shooting to infinity and beyond.','https://www.gamestorrents.nu/juegos-pc/trackmania-sunrise-extreme-clonecd/','2020-06-20 14:32:23');

However a form was in the box that, when returned to Hobbico, entitles the buyer to receive a free helicopter upgrade as soon as its available. Im anxiously awaiting mine. My original version of RealFlight was the very first version, so the jump to G3 was huge for me, as such I may talk about features that were available in G2 as new features, because they are new to me.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n- I found quite a few new features in this simulator. One of the neatest was the virtual flight instructor. While not a brand new feature (G2 had it), it has been expanded and remains a really great feature. This was not some machine talking to you, it was in fact several top ranked pilots, in their own voices and images, flying the aircraft and visually instructing you how to do it. Frank Noll Jr. and Jason Schulman are included for the airplane side. I couldnt have asked for better flight instruction than this, and I dont mean just basic flight instruction (although it does that very well too). If I wanted to know how to do a harrier, I just clicked on Franks name and asked him to show me!\r\n\r\n- The ability to modify or even design my own aircraft within the simulator and fly it was greatly enhanced over previous versions of RealFlight. I was able to view a wireframe model and make almost any modification I desired, and see the change in realtime on the wire frame.\r\n\r\n- Want to fly a competition? How about a Scale Aerobatics free style event, a fun fly limbo or many others? G3 can do it, and does it more capably than G2 did. Fly the contest by yourself or go online and fly against others. How cool is that? But the cool new addition .... is to fly against someone on the same computer! G3 can do that too. A split screen feature allows two people to fly. I had to use the Interlink controller and my own transmitter; one controlled one aircraft the other the second aircraft. It was a lot of fun, formation flying anyone?\r\n\r\nMinimum System Requirements: Windows XP, 2000, ME, 98, Intel Pentium® 1.0 GHz or equivalent, DirectX® 9 (or above) compatible video and sound card, 3D accelerated video card with 32 MB (or more) RAM, 256 MB RAM , 1.3 GB hard drive space\r\nOptimum System Requirements: Pentium® 3.0 or equivalent, 3D accelerated video card with 64 MB RAM (or more), 1 GB RAM\r\nMultiplayer: 56.6 Kbps modem or LAN connection\r\nInterlink Plus Controller: USB Port Compatible PC and\r\nFM or FM-selectable transmitter ( if using the interface mode) ','https://www.gamestorrents.nu/juegos-pc/realflight-rc-flight-simulator-g3-2cds/','2020-06-20 15:12:46');

Featuring Bob, Wendy and the rest of the gang, this CD-ROM will be a favorite with any Bob fan.\r\nIt is graphically superb (as you would expect from the BBC) and all characters are faithful to their on-screen counterparts. The games run smoothly without pixelation and the screens are easy to navigate. A full-color instruction booklet is included, guiding players through installation and activity and providing helpful hints and tips. This should be read before commencing.\r\n\r\nIn the first activity, you help Bob build a park. First you build a pond, then a bandstand and then decorate the park with trees, flowers, bushes, picnic tables and other park essentials. You can view the park in winter or summer mode, then print it out once complete. Next, you help Bob fix the skateboard park for the hapless Spud, then score points as you help the scarecrow perform his skateboard stunts. In Mr Ellis Dinosaur Discovery, the park becomes Jurassic, as you help Mr Ellis piece together the dinosaur bones he has uncovered. Choose from a T-Rex, a Velociraptor or a Triceratops and print out an impression of what the dino would have looked like.\r\n\r\nIn Farmer Pickles Pets Corner, you help Farmer Pickles round up his farmyard strays and lead them back to their correct homes. Next, you help Lofty build a squirrel run, then progress to Bobs Crazy Golf and make Muck collect building materials, while avoiding the mischievous Spud! Once thats built, you help Bob find his first hole-in-one, before joining Bobs Band. Once youve completed all the games, you can open the park in grand style with a fireworks display. But even fun must be earned-you must help Bob and the gang set it all up first!\r\n\r\nAs well as promoting basic PC and mouse skills, Bob Builds a Park will help youngsters to learn hand-to-eye coordination, colors, shapes, musical pitch, planning, animal and dinosaur names and anatomies. It will also develop creativity, spatial awareness, problem-solving and many, many other skills. Varying difficulty levels keep children interested and learning and, true to the Bob the Builder ethos, the package promotes team work, hard work and Bobs trademark can-do attitude. Its recommended for ages three and above: younger users will undoubtedly need supervision and help, particularly with set-up. Altogether, this is another great Bob the Builder package.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Build a Park with Bob - Create endless exciting park designs adding ponds, band stands and flowers. And then view the park in all the different seasons and print out your design!\r\n- Skateboard Spud - Fix the broken skateboard with Bob and then help Spud perform amazing tricks and stunts!\r\n- Bobs Crazy Golf- Help Muck around a maze to collect the pieces he needs to create his golf course.\r\n- Farmer Pickles Pets Corner - Help collect food to lure the various animals into their correct homes!\r\n- Loftys Squirrel Run- Help Lofty to build a run, so the hungry squirrels can reach their nuts.\r\n- Mr Ellis Dinosaur Discovery - Choose to build up to 3 dinosaur skeletons with Bob and Mr Ellis.

Cthulhu Fhtagn! What looks like a Scandinavian sneeze is nothing more than an instantly recognizable phrase for anyone who knows the Cthulhu Mythos, a name given to the mythology that the writer HP Lovecraft invented after suffering horrible nightmares in his life. Very curiously, many of his stories contain protagonists who knew all this hell by their dreams ... which draws a curious line in which it is fiction and what reality. Unfortunately Lovecraft died in poverty without knowing that years later her books would be works of worship, an RPG and even several PC games. In this case, Dark Corners of the Earth.\r\n\r\nDCOTE tells the story of Jack Walters, a policeman with a taste for the paranormal who after an incident in 1915 loses his mind. After a time in the madhouse, they release him as harmless, although he seems a radically different person. In 1922, Jack had another attack and he was put back in the asylum, only to return to normal in 1915: apparently he had a second personality during the last 6 years (it wasn t 7, I know how to count, but it was from the end of 1915 at the beginning of 1922), and neither he nor the doctors can explain how he appeared or how he left. Having recovered his true self, he dedicates himself to being a private detective, trying to understand what he did in recent years and why that change occurred, since he does not remember anything about the period. At this point, he receives a call to search for a missing person in the town of Innsmouth. With nothing better to do, take the only bus over there and from there in more ... hey, better not say it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was looking at reviews before writing this and I was surprised how some gave it a 9, and others a 5. The bad thing is that both are right. I was seldom faced with such an ambiguous game. I usually either love them or make me warm from start to finish. DCOTE is a kind of beating husband, he shows you a lover, he falls in love with you, then he strips you, but he asks for your forgiveness and he is again a love. And one like being stupid, believes the son of a bitch. Then they ask him what that bruise is and we have to say that we fell off the bicycle.\r\n\r\nThe game is a classic mix in first person, with elements of stealth (more than anything at first) and some puzzles. Over there everything in order. The emphasis however is placed on terror and insanity, which means that every time you play it you are nervous or to the point. So let me go from start to finish throughout Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth, not telling you almost nothing so that you don t miss any details when playing it (believe me, I hate spoilers) but so that my curious previous metaphor is demonstrated .\r\n\r\nStart. The game looks a little washed out, it does not have the most impressive textures and models, but it has very cool effects such as raindrops that stick to the monitor as if it were the glass of a car. In addition, it works very well in terms of framerate. We investigated the place, the atmosphere is good, there are surprises, we empathize until we try to go back. We can not. Finally we notice that by default, the game has WAXD keys. Yes. Not WASD. This makes as much sense as asking the player to use the mouse vertically. Well, we changed the key settings, but the excitement is gone. ','https://www.gamestorrents.nu/juegos-pc/call-of-cthulhu-dcote/','2020-06-20 17:01:31');

Utopia, a parallel virtual environment of the real world, was created for them. It was designed to grow and exist independently of the real world. The people (or rather their thoughts, knowledge, imagination and feelings) became part of this new virtual world, allowing its central server, the Mastermind, to develop and prosper.\r\nUtopia became a purgatory for its people as it promised to grant them the ability to create their own paradise. In exchange, the Mastermind was allowed to freely scan each persons emotions, thoughts and feelings. The experiment turned out to be such a success that the Mastermind offered Utopian citizenship to the rest of the non-virtual world. Over time, the experience of Utopia became so popular that its inhabitants eventually outnumbered those remaining in the real world. Thousands of Utopias users refused to exit the virtual world. Hoping to gain immortality each inhabitant sought to become a digital god and create his or her own paradise. The physical world fell apart in their absence.\r\n\r\nThe deterioration of the physical world prompted the government to establish the Department of Anti-Utopian Affairs (AUA), created for the sole purpose of sending elite teams of agents, called Removers, to Utopia. It is only possible to extract a person from Utopia at the moment of his or her virtual death. The agents missions were to disconnect the victims caught in the virtual web and destroy the Mastermind. Unfortunately, at this time all the agents have vanished into Utopia and are not expected to return. Even those who remained devoted to their duty have experienced no security and have failed in their mission to destroy the Mastermind.\r\n\r\nThe players have a choice: they may conform to the ways of Utopia and abide by its laws; or, if they figure out how to free themselves, they can attempt to destroy the Mastermind and rescue the other hostages trapped in the great virtual dream.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploration and battle through 20 vast locations\r\n- Epic Envirnoments with cinematic special effects\r\n- Intense story driven structure packerd with fearsome firepower\r\n- Unique, high energy gun toting gameplay\r\n- 5 kinds of weapons\r\n- Smart AI and interation with dozens of characters\r\n- Real time damage\r\n- Telport System\r\n- Next gen 3d engine ','https://www.gamestorrents.nu/juegos-pc/utopia-city/','2020-07-04 12:12:05');

Let\'s take a look at the strategic genre games of recent years. Three words are enough to describe the environment: orcs, nazis, and robots. On the face of a strategist you would notice a tired face because the Romans themselves always protect themselves from the barbarians and then always in the same way take the beaches in Normandy on the famous D-Day. And this is not for lack of ideas gentlemen, but for fear. Few games have chosen to innovate, how many in recent years? Fahrenheit and Half Life 2 that I remember ...\r\nA different case comes as Big Huge Games present their new work of art, the sequel to their first Rise of Natios but with a big difference: this Rise will have nothing to do with the previous one.\r\n\r\nRACES. The main novelty will be races. We will control the Roman Empire while ... wait I didn\'t mean this. He said that we will control 4 races of which none will be real, but neither will it be imaginary. Let me explain, forget about Romans, Nazis, Orcs and special Marines. Now go to Google and search for Leonardo Da Vinci. Rather his drawings and his experiments because one of the races, the VINCI is based precisely on them. Those strange helicopters, robots and mechanisms that we all find so interesting and rare at the same time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we will have a nice race out of 1001 nights. In this way we are facing another game with arabic elements. With the many there are, only one Prince of Persia ... In this race magic will dominate. Wizards, sorcerers and the best warriors of the Sultan will be at our disposal to defeat the VINCI using mythological creatures such as dragons and everything you can think of.\r\n\r\nEach race will have its weak and strong points. In principle, VINCIs that seem weaker than PERSES (HEAVEN) have large combat machines and robots, with unique tanks and vehicles heavily armored against enemy magic. Metal fortresses built between high valleys and canyons against great palaces with towers that are lost in the skies protected by red dragons and sorcery magic. There will be four races, two magical and two mechanical, although so far only two have been revealed.\r\n\r\nGameplay. Creatures stronger than others like the great bosses and heroes of our army will have special abilities but we will not be forced to keep an eye on them as in the mythical War Craft to improve them. It is enough for us to reap victories over our enemy. Thus for example a beastly enemy and difficult to defeat will be Alim, a genius of HEAVEN who will cast terrifying hexes against our soldiers and will be able to fight alone against an entire army. We will have to collect resources although they would only be two in number. The timonio, fundamental for the construction of buildings. And wealth, an element of will grow with the trade routes that we have established with the kingdoms close to ours to the most distant. The more trade and exchange we have the more our nation will develop, The stronger we will become and the faster we will advance in time leaving behind our enemy and becoming the master of the world. The races will be totally different from each other and the strategies for one will not be valid for the other. Each one must adapt to the one that suits him best.\r\n\r\nGRAPHICS. The graphics of the game will promise in every way. Great textures, HDR light, and detailed units moving real-time across the stage. The environment will be totally destructible seeing how the VINCI machines collapse in pieces or how the height of the palaces of the Heaven is reduced to a level of ground level. Dragons launching flame against the vincesco helicopters, melting their metal while a blast of shrapnel from one of the control towers reaches the body of the animal and knocks it down.\r\n\r\nLORDS, we are facing a great one of the next strategies and if everything continues to go smoothly we will soon enjoy a great strategy game ready to surpass its predecessor and become the king of the genre both alone and in multiplayer, in which They have promised us epic battles of a rapid but fluid development of the races.

This has prompted the launch of a second part of the stories of this peculiar character created by Santiago Segura and how could it be less has led to the release of the corresponding video game. Developed by Virtual Toys and distributed by Electronics Arts, OcioTotal introduces you to Torrente, the cybernetic arm of the Law.\r\nBased on a \"mix\" of both films and in environments that develop real scenarios very widely and precisely, Virtual Toys presents a torrent accurately caricatured in a 3D arcade with which the player can assume the role of the \"crappy policeman\", either in third or first person.\r\n\r\nMadrid and Barcelona serve as stages for this new and striking Torrente, faithful reflection of the original. The most seedy and prototypically cañi of Spain today are submerged among the bits of the CdRom of the Torrente game program. Fun and certainly well developed Torrente collects the most cinematographic elements. Virtual Toys has had the invaluable collaboration of Santiago Segura both in the plot development (it is noted) and in the incorporation of voices with which we will get more than a broad smile.\r\nGame Features\r\nFollowing levels of Crazy Taxi O Quake-style gameplay, the game\'s mechanics focus on the action, with no possibility of interacting with other characters. The graphics engine of the Torrente program reproduces cities with a considerable appearance of life thanks to the number of citizens and vehicles that circulate.\r\nFrom the very beginning of the game we begin by evaluating the appropriate doses of humor with which Torrente provides us in this curious arcade. From the implementation of the tutorial program, the absurd gags and the greediness that has already made the character famous, begin to filter through our audio and video.\r\nWe will start in an easily identifiable urban setting. The Torres Kio, Puerta de Europa, Plaza de Castilla or Puerta de Alcala begin to appear on our screen, serving as a backdrop to a new torrent more \"casposo\" if possible than that of the film versions.\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable element is that of action. Game levels of exceptional development and infrequent in Spanish video games, lead us to a frenetic game action in which the mobility of our antihero is simple and effective. The characters we will meet will be very diverse. Spectacular women sometimes armed to the teeth, thugs from three to four, thieves or dangerous assassins loaded with bazzokas with whom they try to give us a displeasure. Many enemies as the game progresses will attack in greater numbers, without order or concert and possibly without a predetermined \"plan\", a complete chaos in the service of a game whose fun is guaranteed.\r\nTraffic, noise, screaming, racing, ... a whole interactive world at the service of the most interesting sequel to the reviled police: macho, rude, arrogant and heartless. A sweaty and chubby Solid Snake, a Lara Croft \"made in Spain\" with no other curves than that of her huge belly, a 007 with more grace but less grace, but in any case perhaps representing a part of ourselves and that in Streaming the game, it is effectively entertaining and happily endearing.

The incredible thing about this aspect is that the game shows us in real time the deformation that is created at ground level when our units flatten it for energy. All buildings must be at ground level zero. This premise makes the base of our race the largest and most important strategy in the game, which is why, in part, it removes the focus from most RTS in which the strategies are centralized in the variety and number of units that we include in our armies. The main objective is to extend our base to be able to gain more surface and obtain more energy, and later, defend that area from the attacks of enemy races and neutral enemies of the territory. The tools menu will be as confusing as any RTS.

We could already see it in cases like Scrapland or the more than great Alice. The dark and subrealistic aura will continue to be present on this Bad Day in LA where all the disasters that have happened and will happen in a single day in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nBad Day in LA is a game that seeks the laughter of the players based on the most comical and absurd situations that can be derived from the hundreds of disasters that our protagonist Anthony Williams will witness, who is neither more nor less than an African American tramp, who will be seen in the middle of everything that has happened so to speak. At stake we will see how the city is flooded by tsunamis, airplane accidents full of chemical products, Zombies, terrorists, etc., but all full of a hilarious satirical that on more than one occasion will tear a smile from our faces, especially in the comments from our protagonist and the adventure companions that we get to know.\r\n\r\nGoing into technical questions of the game, we see how graphically the style is completely cartoon-like using cel-shading, in which even the underside of the cars seem to be drawn with a pen. Technically the game is not the eighth wonder and sometimes it is even too simple, but it fulfills without any problem setting perfectly this disastrous city. We see how the models are correct but without reaching the quality of current games. The level design is quite original, and we see how scenes as ordinary as a residential neighborhood or a highway can be turned into a whole chaos overflowing with social criticism.\r\n\r\nAt the playable level we realize that it is controlled like any current shooter, that is, the keyboard to move while the mouse controls the character\'s view. We will also have a simple control since we will only have 3 buttons: shoot, interact or speak and jump. Despite the simplicity of its control, it is full of imperfections and inaccuracies that we hope will polish a bit.\r\nThe musics in the demo are not too varied even with the amount of explosions, screams, weapons, etc. They are not paid much attention but they help a lot to that comic atmosphere that surrounds the title. In the demonstration the whole game is in English, although we hope that the final version will be translated into the PC version since it is the only one confirmed for Spanish territory.\r\n\r\nIn short, we hope that Bad Day in LA becomes another masterpiece as it has accustomed us in its American McGee titles. The game will undoubtedly enjoy great fun due to the charisma of its protagonist and the irreverent situations that arise.

Far from being a simple expansion, Dark Crusade will not need the original title to play but we will be able to complete any campaign individually as well as the different maps with any of the seven feasible races, only needing to have Dawn of War installed (or Winter Assault for the Imperial Guard) to unlock their starting races in multiplayer.\r\nOne of the first innovations of Dark Crusade resides in the Campaign mode, which we can face in any of the seven possible perspectives for the conquest of Kronus, a planet with an important strategic situation. The development of this modality is a mix between the typical battles that have identified the saga and a strategic map divided into 25 provinces in the Risk style or other games of the genre such as Dune II or Medieval: Total War.\r\nBy attacking the different enemies, the battles themselves begin, while the moment we capture a territory we get a series of additional benefits that we can spend on reinforcements (such as more units in the occupied areas) or a series of surprises that appear when the fighting.\r\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of this text, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade is much more than just an expansion, not simply because you can play without needing the original (except for some multiplayer possibilities) but because of the inclusion of two complete races, new units for those already available and the renewed campaign mode.

Both the representation of the castles and the production systems have been clear reflections of those existing in past times in our history. These details, the trademark of the house, are what have managed to place the previous titles in a well differentiated place within the strategy in real time.\r\nThis would be nothing more than an anecdote if we did not find such a strong contrast with the new creation of Firefly. Legends will be the first in the series where fantastic character elements are introduced into the game mechanics. Fans will be happy to know that these developments have a favorable impact on the final gameplay, bringing excitement to the games.\r\nWhat caught our attention the most when we started in Legends is the disappearance of the classic grass-ridden terrains, which have been replaced by rocky plains, or frozen wastelands. The environment of the maps is much more rugged and less uniform, being very attractive both visually and strategically. The conquest of territories has been maintained since the previous title in the series, so we can expand our domains by acquiring the villas arranged by the mapping.\r\nThe new and attractive fortifications will look magnificent in their construction and will allow us to build our castle in a way that is quite true to reality, within this new fantastic background. The towers and walls will be our companions at all times, allowing us to carry out an architect\'s work that will make sense when resisting the spectacular sieges.

Will the online work smoothly for once? There have always been \"buts\" in the PES, but the truth is that the \"pros\" are infinitely more abundant compared to their negative points, something that both independent critics and the public make see season after season.\r\nLast year, with PES5 a fairly complete and robust set was achieved both in the technical section and in the gameplay. There were mistakes, yes, like that referee who cut the game almost every play to score fouls, many unlikely. Upon receiving the beta of PES6 that we discussed weeks ago, we found ourselves with another “even” version that left us a certain aftertaste to satisfaction along with a somewhat disappointing residue in several sections. However, we have to say that the final version has eradicated most of the negative feelings, but has maintained them in some aspects. It seems that a lot of work has been done to improve, and PES6 may be the end point of the saga on PS2, and its goodbye before moving fully and consequently to the \"next-gen\".\r\nThe ball is already running on the grass.

The story takes place on the planet Ragol, a planet colonized by the Pioneer project. The Pioneer project grew out of despair as the worlds were being destroyed and consumed. While plans for an evacuation were being created, countless robots were dispatched to search for a habitable planet. When it was discovered, Pioneer 1 was launched to establish a colony. Their arrival on the planet Ragol confirmed that the planet was suitable, and the settlers began to prepare the planet for the arrival of the refugees, building what they called the Central Dome.\r\n\r\n7 years later, Pioneer 2 completes its journey with hundreds of thousands of refugees inside, but upon entering orbit and establishing communication with the Central Dome, a huge explosion occurs ... and the entire planet teeters. All contact with the men and women of Pioneer 1 is lost ... From here begins Phantasy Star Online. You will be a hunter, a mercenary hired by the government to investigate what has happened on the planet Ragol. The once peaceful planet Ragol has become a dangerous place, the indigenous fauna, once peaceful, will now attack humans without thinking twice. In the mines there are mysterious robotic and mutated beasts, called \"Altered Beasts\" ... Something strange has happened on the planet Ragol. And your mission will be to find out.\r\n\r\n\r\ncharacter classes, which in turn comprise 3 classes: Hunters (Hunter), Soldiers (Ranger) and Mages (Force). To choose our character we will have to take into account how it will evolve and the distribution of its qualities. Before going on to describe the different types of characters, it should be clarified that there are 3 races: Humans, who are the most balanced with a normal command of attack and techniques. The Newmen or new men, beings with a superior intelligence that allows them to master the techniques but with less attack power, and lastly the androids, who have great attack and defense force, but cannot use techniques (androids are machines and have no soul, and neither do they go to heaven).\r\n\r\nHUmar: A human hunter and the most balanced character of all. You can use techniques, melee and use firearms.\r\n\r\nHUnewearl: A newman hunter. It has less atauqe power than the HUmar but a better mastery of techniques.\r\n\r\nHUcast: An android hunter. It has the highest attack power and the longest life, but cannot use techniques.\r\n\r\nRAmar: Another balanced character. This human soldier skillfully uses firearms and can use techniques as well.\r\n\r\nRAcast: The HUcast namesake but far-reaching. It has a lot of offensive and defensive power, and can use all weapons but no technique.\r\n\r\nRAcaseal: Another android ranger, but this time in a female version. It has less attack power than RAcast, but more evasion power.\r\n\r\nFOmarl: A human magician. He has great skill with techniques but little attack and defense power. The most balanced of magicians.\r\n\r\nFOnewm: It is the character that can use all the techniques. It has little offensive and defensive power, but if it is controlled it is the best character.\r\n\r\nFOnewearl: The female version of FOnewm.

This animated story now presented by CMY Multimedia is inspired by the Middle Ages. It is about the friendship and adventures of two children in Europe, Azur and Asmar, who meet years later in the Middle East, as teenagers. Both share the desire to release the Djinns Fairy and only their deep friendship and their desire to help overcome their differences will achieve the goal of uniting their two cultures.\r\n\r\nThis adventure game highlights education in values, at the same time that it educates children in education without differences, brotherhood between different cultures and peoples and non-discrimination based on color or race.\r\n\r\nIn Azur and Asmar the child can alternate between the two characters and guide them to the final goal: Free the Fairy from the Djinns. The game is set in seven Magical Scenarios, between which the two main characters will travel, captured directly from the film: Arid Deserts, Mythical Palaces, Impressive Precipices, Dark Caverns, etc., on the other hand, to say that, the child will be able to choose between thirteen different levels of play, depending on the difficulty you want.

The games high level of character interaction will create a living hospital thats part soap opera and part comedy.\r\n\r\nA move away from micro-management life-simulation games, Hospital Tycoon will create emerging situations that are as entertaining as they are challenging. The manic medical teams have to deal with patients suffering from the most peculiar ailments, such as the man afflicted with Monkey Nuts and the office worker diagnosed with Stress Zombosis, and set about curing them with equally odd treatments.\r\n\r\nAt the Sapphire Beach Medical Institute, the lives and loves of the hospitals doctors and nurses, as well as the sneezes and diseases of its patients, will come alive this June when Hospital Tycoon launches exclusively for PC. Fusing Tycoon style gameplay with character simulation and a light-hearted narrative, Hospital Tycoon is set to give players a soap-opera feel as they progress through episodes of hospital dramas Story Mode.\r\n\r\nEach episode in Hospital Tycoon explores a plot involving certain members of the hospitals staff and some very interesting patients, while at the same time challenging players to find cures for bizarre new illnesses. Diseases range from the everyday Explosive Sneezing - where a simple sneeze can launch the unfortunate patient several feet into the air, to the more rare Monkey Nuts - where patients sprout fur, climb furniture and favor bananas over everyday person food.\r\n\r\nHospital Tycoon staff members have rich behaviors that players can nurture and influence throughout the game. Gamers may choose to encourage a friendship or a falling-out of sorts, and can train staff to improve their skill levels. Players will also be challenged to manage and maintain each hospital, creating dedicated areas to support additional medical needs, including surgery, diagnosis, physiotherapy and more.\r\n\r\nAs more patients are cured, the more players can expand their medical empire and attract new, and even more interesting patients. However, as the hospital becomes busier, players will have to be on the lookout for the spread of infectious conditions or theyll soon have an epidemic running riot throughout the facility.

In continuous technical development for various platforms, Neon has over 18 months of work with a team of more than 30 expert technicians. The Neon engine has been conceived to build Colin McRae: DIRT from its foundations, with a technology developed exclusively for the new generation formats. In no case have we limited ourselves to adapting the technology of the previous McRae tech in DIRT.\r\n\r\nNeon will guarantee an exciting DIRT off-road racing cocktail where vertigo and thirst for adrenaline combine perfectly with the gameplay typical of the Colin McRae saga. With more than 40 officially licensed vehicles covering 12 classes of cars, fans of the McRae saga will experience the rush of driving official two- or four-wheel drive cars, plus classics and rear-wheel drive vehicles, including the Colin McRae and Subaru Impreza R4 prototype with which Travis Pastrana was awarded the X Games. All these vehicles prepared to compete for the most challenging and dangerous rally stages in the world.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gavin Cheshire, Vice President of Codemasters Studios:\r\n? Neon offers an engine that increases range and possibilities beyond what an existing technology upgrade could have allowed. The first thing that catches your eye is the visual detail and physics that produce incredible particle effects. Neon manages to delve into seemingly insignificant details, but capable of creating the most realistic and immersive environments in the racing genre. \"\r\n\r\nThe level of detail that Neon offers allows the team to design places and environments with the highest possible fidelity: each one with a unique appearance and atmospheres, even recreating the effects of the wind. By using real-time physics to design air movements, everything will be affected by the wind: smoke from the tailpipe, trees, vegetation, side flags, rain, and the vehicles themselves. The cars will produce chokes that will affect all the elements that they exceed and will also generate a trail in real time.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the damage will contemplate the dent of the sheet and the breakage of the glass. Any element of the environment that you crash into will be realistically destroyed. Small trees split and bend, grass is trampled underfoot, wood splinters, and stone falls to pieces. Even a car may end up stamped into a tree if the crash is hard enough. ','https://www.gamestorrents.nu/juegos-pc/colin-mcrae-dirt-english/','2020-07-14 09:46:52');

Based on a modified DooM engine, Heretic pioneered a revolutionary new inventory system for character item use that has become commonplace in the FPS genre. Id Software published the game under its flag and it was distributed by GT Interactive.\r\n\r\nPlayers took the role of Corvus, an Elven hero whose race was nearly eliminated by a horde of evil monsters from another dimension. The first episode of Heretic was released as Shareware as a precursor to the full version of the game, Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeXen - Beyond Heretic (1995)\r\n\r\nRaven Software s HeXen actually began development as an expansion for Heretic that was originally slated to hit the shelves as \"Heretic II.\" However, the game design so expanded beyond the original game that this proposed the expansion of the Heretic universe took on a bold new identity of its ownΓÇªHeXen: Beyond Heretic.\r\n\r\nHeXen was developed over a period of 8 months, published by Id Software and distributed by GT Interactive in 1995. The game introduced the 3-D gaming world to the \"hub system\" of level progression, rotating polygonal brushes and multiple character classes that were available in both single player and multiplayer. All of this combined to help HeXen raise the bar for the first-person shooter genre. HeXen pushed Id Software s DooM engine to its absolute limits and surpassed Heretic as Raven Software s most popular, highly acclaimed title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeathKings of the Dark Citadel (1996)\r\n\r\nWhere HeXen Ends, the True Nightmare Begins. Deathkings of the Dark Citadel is the only official expansion of the original HeXen game. This add-on pack features 20 new single player levels from the original HeXen team as well as a host of new multiplayer options.\r\n\r\nDeathkings of the Dark Citadel was the first true game expansion that Raven Software ever produced. In addition to providing three new hubs for the original HeXen, the Deathkings expansion was the first multiplayer game that allowed eight players to connect to a LAN simultaneously.\r\n','https://www.gamestorrents.nu/juegos-pc/heretic-hexen-deathkings-of-the-dark-citadel-english/','2020-07-14 10:19:26');

Powered by the Quake engine, HeXen II was developed from 1996 to 1997 on a brutal production schedule, published by Id Software and distributed by Activision Inc.\r\n\r\nOne of the most highly anticipated releases of 1997, HeXen II was the first game from an outside developer to ship with Quake engine technology. The game featured four single player hubs and deathmatch capabilities for 16 players while simultaneously offering four character classes, each with four weapons with dual fire modes for a total of 32 unique weapon effects. In addition, HeXen II was the first 3-D shooter to feature transparent water effects in both hardware and software rendering modes and one of the only fully 3-D games to feature single player cooperative gameplay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHexen II Mission Pack - Portal of Praevus (1998)\r\n\r\nHeXen II: Portal of Praevus began production in late 1997, following the successful launch of the original game. The team decided to make the expansion much more than a pack of new levels for HeXen II. The goal was to make Portal of Praevus as close to an entirely new game as possible for buyers of the original HeXen II. To do this, the team made two new hubs, 15 new single player levels, three new enemies and added another character class ... the Demoness.\r\n\r\nHeXen II owners could play through Portal of Praevus as the former minion of Eidolon or as any of the original four characters. HeXen II: Portal of Praevus merged seamlessly with the Hexen II world and offered a wealth of new options and opportunities for mayhem in both single player and multiplayer gaming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeretic II (1998)\r\n\r\nDuring the development of Portal of Praevus, Raven Software worked feverishly to lay the groundwork for yet another revolutionary action game: Heretic II. Based on Id Software s Quake II engine, Heretic II successfully blended first-person shooter action with a third-person camera to create an entirely new game genre.\r\n\r\nThis new perspective on the Heretic / HeXen universe was the biggest critical success in Raven Software s storied history. With dozens of awards and numerous accolades, Heretic II showed the world that third-person action games could be fun and intuitive, while it solidified Raven s reputation as one of the industry s top game developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: CloneCD-Images ','https://www.gamestorrents.nu/juegos-pc/hexen-ii-portal-of-praevus-heretic-ii-english/','2020-07-14 10:21:12');
