                                          Forex is the international currency market. Its name is a commonly used abbreviation that stands for <span class="bold">FOReign EXchange</span>. Though still relatively young as compared to other financial institutions (it was only established in the 1970s), today Forex is the most popular and dynamically developing market.<br><br>
                            The tremendous amount of more than <span class="bold">4 trillion US dollars</span> is traded on the forex market every day, which exceeds the total turnover of all stock exchanges in the United States thirty-fold.<br><Br>
                            As any other financial market, Forex is based on trading a certain set of goods. On Forex this set of goods is represented by the national currencies of various countries.</p>
