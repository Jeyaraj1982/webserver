Women in the age range of 15-35 years are admitted in this home. Children up to the age of 7 years are also admitted in the home along with the mothers. These children's primary schooling is borne by the programme which includes expenditures on tuition fees, cost of books and study materials etc. Tailoring, knitting and kitchen garden activities are taught to these residents during their stay. Efforts are also established to mainstream these women in society either through vocational training and promotion of their independent income generating activities.</p>

Children are highly vulnerable to the negative health consequences associated with many environmental exposures. Children receive proportionately larger doses of environmental toxicants than adults, and thefact that their organs and tissues are rapidly developing makes them particularly susceptible to chemical insults. Research in children&rsquo;s health looks at the effects of air pollution on respiratory diseases such as allergies and asthma, the impact of lead, mercury, and other environmental contaminants on cognitive development and behavior, and the influence of prenatal and early life exposures on growth and development. Thus the Le consal bountiful trust plans to take care of all aspects of child health.</div></td>

 A Vast numbers of children across the world become infected with HIV every year. Without treatment, thousands die as a result of AIDS. In addition, millions more children who are not infected with HIV are indirectly affected by the epidemic, as a result of the death and suffering that AIDS causes in their families and their communities.<br />
    <br />
   Despite the severity of this situation, many people still think of AIDS as something that affects adults. Some people occasionally think of ‘AIDS babies’, and children who have lost one or both of their parents to AIDS – AIDS orphans – are sometimes in the media. But since HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is commonly transmitted through sex or drug use, people don’t really think of it affecting children. It does, though – and millions of children around the world continue to have their lives damaged by HIV.

We are conducting Awareness Programs for Alcoholics we also take care
of the treatment and rehabilitation to the best of our abilities. Alcoholics
are identified and educated that alcoholism is a treatable disease

and motivated for treatment. Those who enroll for the camp are given
wholesome care, treatment and life skills for a rehabilitated life by the
Hospital. They are then followed up on a monthly basis for a year.</p><br />
<br />

<p>Treated alcoholics are involved in educating and motivating fellow
alcoholics to give up alcohol and to avail treatment in our camp.
Encouraged by the success of the program, Le Consal has embarked on a
three year project to create Alcohol-free Villages at least in Kancheepuram
and Thiruvallur District in Tamilnadu.</p><br />

    <p class="conttxt6">Blood is the river of life that flows in our body. World statistics show  that today, blood is the most sort-after body part in the world. Demand and  supply are slowly drifting further and further apart. India&rsquo;s daily  estimated requirement of blood is roughly 40 million units of 250 cc blood  packages. Of which only 500,000 units are available. By conducting frequent  blood donation camps we aim to reduce this deficit by our own little way.</p>
