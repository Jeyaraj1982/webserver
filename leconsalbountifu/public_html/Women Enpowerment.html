		    At our lady of Refuge home, we provide temporary accommodation, counseling,  legal assistance, carrier guidance and training in various skills and trades  etc., to very marginalized, troubled and destitute or abandoned women. We also  would like to provide a home away from home to the women who are affected by  domestic violence, In-Law problems and psychic disorders.<br />

    <span class="conttxt6 style1">Women Self Employment programs</span></strong></p>
		  
          <p class="conttxt6">Le Consal bountiful trust has started a Self  Help Women Development Program. This program regroups village women and brings  them and their families towards economic and social independence. Our  Organization gives income generation training among women self help groups of  village women by giving free computer training, tailoring, art &amp;  handi-craft training and training to prepare homemade products.<br /><br />
            Le Consal  bountiful trust understands the difficulties of women. Women live as second  class citizen because of many factors, such as lack of education, freedom,  finance, job opportunities, skills and lack of proper recognition in the  families and in the society at large. To eliminate some of these factors and to  help women in different ways, Le Consal bountiful trust through self-help women  program plans different activities.<br />
  <br />
            Le Consal bountiful trust believes that the best help that one can give to the  woman is to build up their capacities. Capacity to think, to express  themselves, to plan and to execute. Some of the activities taken up by LE  CONSAL BOUNTIFUL TRUST for women development are: AWARENESS meetings in the  villages. Women become aware of their situation and learn to appropriate ways  to better themselves economically, socially, intellectually, psychologically  and morally. Regular group meetings, discussions and group dynamics bring about  the desired affinity between members. The psychological bond between them  becomes stronger. They gain unity and group spirit which create togetherness.<br />
  <br />
            Various activities are conducted by us in rural areas to develop awareness  among women to be compassionate with persons less fortunate than them, such as  the old, blind, sick, orphans, and the handicapped in their own villages.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
            Informal Education was started from the beginning of the year and over 1000  women have learnt to read and write. Le Consal bountiful trust gave training to  57 special teachers with innovative techniques and new creative approaches in  handling the women in reading and writing without much difficulties.<br />
  <br />
            In rural areas LE CONSAL BOUNTIFUL TRUST organize health camps for women.  Through this camps group discussions are initiated for women to gain knowledge  on HIV / AIDS, family planning, etc. Through eye camps, women also learn to  respect the elders and to support them by taking them to camps, for eye  operations. The Trust organize Clean and Green Environment programme in rural  areas for a clean and healthy village atmosphere.&nbsp; For this purpose Tree plantation and Kitchen  gardens were proposed as practical models. Water &amp; Sanitation is also part  of a healthy environment. The Trust has executed several projects&nbsp; for construction of drinking-water tanks and  wells to give access &nbsp;to safe drinking  water for the rural masses.</p><br/>
          <p class="conttxt6"><strong class="conttxt6 style1">Home for the Aged</strong><br />
            
          The Aged are not taken care of as effectively as they really deserve, when they  are at home. Many old people are left to die without food, proper medication  and care due to sheer poverty and negligence and sometimes due to the cruelty  of family members. We have come across many NRI families also, who expressed  concern about the well being of their elders back home. It is the same when  husband &amp; wife go to work. Something good needs to be done. It is here that  our trust steps in to create an environment where the aged feel safe, secure,  cared and comfortable and to provide a home for their stay as a community so  that they don't feel lonely, left out, abandoned or unloved. They will be happy  hale &amp; healthy and mentally sound in their new, adopted home.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
