<p class="conttxt6">Women have always been marginalized and relegated to the status of subjugated class in the Indian society. Due to lack ofspecific implementation of plans, local communities especially women have remained outside the scope and benefits of
government schemes and programmes.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="conttxt6">Women have not actively participated in their emancipation due to their lack of economic independence and illiteracy. There is a
 need to address the issue by raising the status of women. The key lies in women empowerment through economic self-
sufficiency and higher awareness levels on social, political and legal issues through mobilization.</p>

        <p class="conttxt6">The failure of execution of  many laws has been attributed to the beneficiaries' lack of awareness.  Therefore an emergent need was felt for generating awareness of rights as  knowledge is the central focus and is a source of power.</p>

Their culture  &amp; art represent a very colourful and vivid social and cultural heritage of  the country that is persisting from pre-historic times until this day inspite  many vicissitudes. In the wake of globalization and modernization the tribal  communities in postmodern India, which are nearly 500 of them, were able to  retain their age-old cultures and art successfully and consistently. They have  also contributed significantly their share in the composite culture of India,  which is called today Indian Culture. The tribal history, culture, art, and all  the varied aspects of their folklore though attract each year to the tribal  regions, tourists, scholars, media persons, art&nbsp;  historians both from India and abroad in large number even though their  history is concealed in the mist of time. Much is being done by the Government  of India and State Government to preserve and promote the valuable tribal  cultural heritage of India but genuinely a lot remains to be done.&nbsp; <br />

To have a clean and neat environment in rural areas the villagers were advised to take up, Tree plantation and Kitchen gardens as two simple models. A Water & Sanitation also forms part of a healthy environment, the trust has taken efforts in collaboration with government agencies to construct the water tanks and wells for providing safe drinking water to the rural people.</p></td>
