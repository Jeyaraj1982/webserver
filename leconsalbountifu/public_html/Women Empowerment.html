<span class="subhead2"><strong>Home for the Aged</strong></span>
		<p>

<br />
The Aged are not taken care of as effectively as we really desire, when they are at home. many old people are left to die with out food, proper medication and care due to sheer poverty and negligence and some times due to the cruelty of family members . We have come across many NRI families also, who expressed concern about the well being of their elders back home. It is the same when husband & wife go to work. Some thing good needs to be done. It is here that our trust steps in to create an environment where the aged feel safe, secure, cared and comfortable and to provide a home for their stay as a community so that they don't feel lonely left out, abandoned or unloved. They will be happy hale & healthy and mentally sound in their new, adopted home.</p>

<span class="subhead2"><strong>Helping hand by: LE CONSAL BOUNTIFUL TRUST</strong></span>
		<p>

<br />
Le Consal bountiful trust understands the difficulties of women. Women live as second class citizen because of many factors, such as lack of education, freedom, finance, job opportunities, skills and lack of proper recognition in the families and in the society at large. To eliminate some of these factors and to help women in different ways, Le Consal bountiful trust through self-help women program plans different activities.<br /><br />

Le Consal bountiful trust believes that the best help that one can give to the woman is to build up their capacities. Capacity to think, to express themselves, to plan and to execute. Some of the activities taken up by LE CONSAL BOUNTIFUL TRUST for women development are: AWARENESS meetings in the villages. Women become aware of their situation and learn appropriate ways to better themselves economically, socially, intellectually, psychologically and morally. Regular group meetings, discussions and group dynamics bring about the desired affinity between members. The psychological bond between them becomes stronger. They gain unity and group spirit which create togetherness.<br /><br />

Various activities are conducted by us in rural areas to develop awareness among women to be compassionate with less fortunate than them, such as old, blind, sick, orphans, handicapped people in their own villages.<br /><br />

Informal Education was started from the beginning of the year and over 1000 women have learnt to read and write. Le Consal bountiful trust gave training to 57 special teachers with innovative techiniques and new creative approaches in handling the women in reading and writing without much difficulties.<br /><br />


In rural areas LE CONSAL BOUNTIFUL TRUST organized health camps for women. Through this camps group discussions were organised for women to gain knowledge on HIV/AIDS, family planning, etc. Through eye camps, women also learn to respect the elders and to support them by taking them to camps, for eye operations. And Trust organised Clean and Green Environment in rural areas for a clean and healty village atmosphere, for this purpose Tree plantation and Kitchen gardens were the models for good environment.Water & Sanitation was also a part of healthy environment, where the Trust organised formation of good drinking-water tanks and wells to access for safe drinking purposes. </p>
